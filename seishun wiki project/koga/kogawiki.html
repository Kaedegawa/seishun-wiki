  <h1>Tomoe Koga</h1>
 
  <h2>Laplace's Demon</h2>
  
 
  <p>Tomoe Koga is the cute first-year who manages to rope Sakuta into pretending to be a couple until summer break in order to avoid being ostracized by her circle of friends at school. While making appearances throughout most of the anime, she only takes on a main character role for episodes 4 – 6 during the Laplace’s Demon arc.<p>
