  <p>Kaede Azusagawa is the little sister of Sakuta Azusagawa, and arguably the first out of all the main characters in the anime to develop puberty syndrome. Kaede can always be found at the Azusagawa apartment, where she lives with Sakuta, away from their parents.</p>
  <p>There are two Kaedes in the story, "Panda Kaede" and "Kaede". However this isn't revealed until the final episodes.</p>
