  <h1>Shoko Makinohara</h1>
 
  <h2>The Dreaming Girl</h2>
  
 
  <p>Shoko has two distinct appearances throughout the first seven volumes of the series.
  
  <br>Middle School<br>
 
  The current Shoko, which Sakuta calls "Makinohara", is a short young girl who is usually seen holding an umbrella outside.
  
  <br>High School<br>
  
  The older Shoko, which Sakuta calls "Shoko-san", has grown relatively taller. She's a beautiful girl who is seen wearing the Minegahara High school uniform, and later she is also seen wearing a white dress. When simulating a marriage with Sakuta, her dress shows a scar, due to her eventually successful heart operation.<p>
